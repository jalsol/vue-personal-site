# My personal site, in Vue 3!

Now live at <a href="https://jalsol.xyz">jalsol.xyz</a>!

I started working on this project as a way to get myself used to Vue, as my
first front-end framework. I also wanted to create a new website _from scratch_
(with the help of some toolings, ofc), instead of using a Jekyll template.

The last web project I worked on prior to this one was back in 2020, for ViSEF.
It feels great to get my hands back on doing such work again.

My intention has been for fun, as I don't see myself becoming a competent
front-end developer in the future. I'm more of a back-end person, but I'm glad
how this turns out (and I hope you do, too).
